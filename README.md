# Driving License Management System

This is an educational project built as part of **Course 19 – Programming Advices**.  
The goal is to simulate a real workflow for managing driving licenses, but the system does **not include full production-level validation**, as it was developed primarily for learning purposes.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **C# .NET**
- **Windows Forms**
- **ADO.NET**
- **MS SQL Server**

## 🗄 Database Structure

The system contains around **14 database tables** responsible for storing:

- Drivers
- Licenses
- Applications
- Tests (theoretical & practical)
- Payments
- Replacement & Renewal Requests

## 🔄 System Features

- Renew existing licenses
- Replace lost or damaged licenses
- Manage driver information
- Manage test requests and results
- Application workflow (Submit → Schedule Test → Issue License)
- Complex SQL transactions to ensure data consistency

## 🎯 Learning Purpose

This project is created to practice:

- OOP principles in real applications
- 3 Tier Architecture
